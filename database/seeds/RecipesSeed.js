          notes:'My preference is for corn-fed chickens as they are plump and the meat is moist. Frozen chickens are always handy to have on hand but a fresh chicken will produce crisper skin and juicer meat. To thaw a frozen whole chicken the most efficient method is to place the frozen bird in its plastic wrapping into the sink and run a continuous gentle stream of cold water over it.',
